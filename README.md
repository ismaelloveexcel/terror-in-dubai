## 🎮 About The Game

**SAVE ISMAEL** is a personal gift project - a Stranger Things-inspired first-person shooter set in an "Upside Down" version of Dubai. Uncle Ismael has gone missing, and it's up to Aidan to venture through corrupted Dubai landmarks to find him and defeat the terrifying Vecna.

### Story Synopsis

> *Mammoo Ismael was supposed to meet Aidan at Ibn Battuta Mall for their regular movie night. He never showed up. Instead, Aidan received a cryptic voice note about "something wrong" and "the lights looking different."*
>
> *Now Aidan must journey through six corrupted Dubai locations, collecting evidence of his uncle's path while battling creatures from the Upside Down. The Mind Flayer and Vecna await at the end of this nightmare...*
